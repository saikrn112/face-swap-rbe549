problems
--------
1: indices_in_a is maynot be integer
    bilinear interploation? -- scipy.interpolate.interp2d
2: patch shapes are not same so indices from B might not map within image A
    should we add boundaries as control points
3: triangulation is not same because control points might not be aligning properly
    should we ignore such triangles
    verify:
        why vertices are not satisfying inverted barycentric coords
            as a workaround, use shapely and check if point is in triangle
        change dst_shape coords reference to image_coords
