problems
--------
1: indices_in_a is maynot be integer
    bilinear interploation? -- scipy.interpolate.interp2d
2: patch shapes are not same so indices from B might not map within image A
    should we add boundaries as control points
3: triangulation is not same because control points might not be aligning properly
    should we ignore such triangles
    verify:
        why vertices are not satisfying inverted barycentric coords
            as a workaround, use shapely and check if point is in triangle
        change dst_shape coords reference to image_coords

TODOs
1: coords_to maynot be an integer
   bilinear interploation? -- scipy.interpolate.interp2d

2: patch shapes are not same, so coords from B might not map within image A
   should we add boundaries as control points - we did, might need to add more
   points on the boundary


TODOs
1. even though landmarks are mapping correctly, rest of the indices are not
   in fact, they are going negative and out of bounds of image dimensions which
   doesnt make sense
   - can add rectangle's middle points for better warping?
   - plot how f_x and f_y mapping is changing w.r.t to x,y to get better idea of
    the fit
   - maybe the RBF that's used is not a good fit?

2. changing lambda is affecting the output a lot, so probably have to plot
   function outputs against that to check if they make sense, currently 1e-3
   looks stable

3. Maybe the landmarks are not mapping one to one correctly, giving a weird fit
    plot the landmarks like how the fiducials are plotted


TODOs (as of 28/9/22):
1. Warping for both faces in the same image
2. Warping on a video
3. Blending
